# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Natalia, but obviously you can tell that from my username ðŸ˜„ 
</br>
---
I am passionate about 2 things: front-end development and sport and honestly? I think that one has an influence on another. While I'm working out I am pushing myself to the limits and go one step further. I'm thinking: "If I can do this then I can do anything. Nothing is impossible if I try hard enough and don't give up" - and this is what I do.
</br> </br>
Currently I'm looking for my first opportunity to work as a **Junior Frontend Developer**, so if my projects seems interesting to you **don't hesitate to contact me!**
</br>
## Goals for 2020
To make the above sentence disappear.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GatsbyJS

- âš¡ Fun fact: once I thought that coding is some kind of black magic, not understandable for normal people like me. But then my friend told me he want to learn it, so I asked him "do you know anything about it?", he said: "Nah, but I'll learn", and I don't know why, but it hit me hard with its simplicity. This is why I started this journey. I saw another challenge in it and I like to challenge myself.
